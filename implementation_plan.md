# Dota 2 Hero Ranker Implementation Plan

This project implements a tournament-style ranker for Dota 2 characters. Users pick between two heroes until a final winner is determined.

## 🎨 Design Direction
- **Theme**: Premium Dark, Dota 2 aesthetic (Neon accents, glassmorphism).
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions between rounds, hover effects on hero cards.
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif (Outfit or Inter).

## 🛠️ Components
1. **Hero Card**: Displays hero name and image with a selection glow.
2. **VS Divider**: Stylish visual separator.
3. **Progress Tracker**: Shows how many matchups are left.
4. **Winner Podium**: Full-screen celebration of the top choice.

## 📂 Structure
- `index.html`: Entry point.
- `src/style.css`: Stylesheet.
- `src/app.js`: Logic.
- `assets/heroes/`: Hero images.

## 🚀 Roadmap
1. Setup basic HTML/CSS layout.
2. Implement tournament logic in JS.
3. Add animations and polish.
4. Generate/placeholder images.
